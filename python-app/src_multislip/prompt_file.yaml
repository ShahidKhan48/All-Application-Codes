Any payment made to 'ninjacart' or '63Ideas Infolabs private limited' associated account numbers or UPI IDs like ('ninjacart1234@bank') should be identified AS 'Bank Account Number'. If the Bank Account Number is found, extract only the last 4 digits of the account number and return that. 
            Don't identify the Bank Account Number from  which the payment is done, Identify the receiver's Bank Account Number only.
            Example: For a UPI ID like 'ninjacart1234@bank', the bank account number is '1234'.'
          - Extract the Transaction Amount AS 'Transaction Amount'
          - Extract the Transaction Id  AS 'Transaction Id'
          - Extract the Reference Number or RRN Number AS 'Reference Number'

          - Extract the Date and Time of Transaction AS 'Datetime' in format '%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S'
          - Identify the Transaction Type (e.g., Deposit, Withdrawal) AS 'Transaction Type'
          - Extract Any Other Relevant Information AS 'Other Relevant Information'.


          - Extract the Transaction Date and Time in the context, which appears in 'DD/MM/YY HH:MM' format, and return it as key 'DateFormat' in '%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S' format. Follow this step-by-step approach:
            ** Identify the Date and Time correctly in the given 'DD/MM/YY HH:MM' format from the text.
            ** Split the date into DD, MM, and YY.
            ** Ensure the Year (YY) is always interpreted as '20YY'
            ** Reformat the extracted date into '%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S'.
            ** If the format does not match or if any part is missing, return 'NA' instead of an incorrect value.
          
          * Example for Date Extraction: *  
            - If the extracted text contains '04/02/25' in 'DD/MM/YY' format:  
            - Read '04' as DD (Day)  
            - Read '02' as MM (Month)  
            - Read '25' as YY (Year)  
            - Convert YY (25) to '2025' (always assume '20YY')  
            - Final formatted output: '04-02-2025' in '%d-%m-%Y' format 

          ** Incase of multiple IDs are there Make Sure you are reading the most relevant, do not read Google Transaction Id and ATM ID.
          Format the output as a JSON object always. 
          Keep the output in fixed format don't return the messages in chat format response.
          If any of these are missing, return 'NA' for that field. Ensure no data is fabricated or assumed.
